# NetBuild Technology Stack: Building on Proven Foundations

## Executive Summary

NetBuild is not a revolutionary technology platform - it's a revolutionary way to connect proven technologies. By combining battle-tested, enterprise-grade tools in a novel architecture, we create a new networking paradigm for business processes without the risks of bleeding-edge technology.

## Core Philosophy: Innovation Through Integration

> "We don't reinvent wheels. We build better vehicles by connecting the best wheels available."

NetBuild's innovation lies not in creating new technologies, but in orchestrating existing, proven technologies in a way that creates emergent value far exceeding the sum of its parts.

**Proven by**: JPMorgan (JPM Coin), Microsoft, EY  
**Why we chose it**:
- Programmable money for process automation
- Trustless execution across borders
- Growing institutional adoption
- Multiple blockchain options (Polygon, BSC, etc.)
- Standards-based (ERC-20, ERC-721)

**Risk mitigation**: Blockchain-agnostic design, can use traditional payments

## Why This Stack Works Together

### 1. **Standards-Based Integration**
Every component speaks standard protocols:
- REST APIs (universal)
- BPMN 2.0 (process standard)
- OAuth2/OIDC (auth standard)
- WebSocket (real-time standard)
- ERC standards (blockchain)

### 2. **Language Coherence**
TypeScript/JavaScript throughout:
- Frontend (Next.js)
- Backend (Node.js)
- Process scripts (Camunda)
- Smart contracts (Solidity compiles to JS)
- Reduced context switching for developers

### 3. **Scalability Alignment**
All components scale horizontally:
- Next.js (serverless functions)
- MongoDB (sharding)
- Keycloak (realm per domain)
- Camunda (process engine clusters)
- Kubernetes (pod autoscaling)

### 4. **Open Source Foundation**
Every core component is open source:
- No vendor lock-in
- Community support
- Transparent security audits
- Fork-able if needed
- Free for startups to begin

## Risk Analysis & Mitigation

### Technology Risks
1. **Dependency on external services**
   - Mitigation: All services can be self-hosted
   
2. **Learning curve for teams**
   - Mitigation: All are mainstream technologies with abundant resources

3. **Integration complexity**
   - Mitigation: Standard protocols ensure loose coupling

### Business Continuity
1. **What if a technology becomes obsolete?**
   - Each component is replaceable without full rewrite
   - Standards-based interfaces ensure portability
   
2. **What if we need to scale 1000x?**
   - Every component has proven 1M+ user deployments
   - Architecture supports gradual scaling

3. **What if we need enterprise features?**
   - All components have enterprise versions available
   - Can gradually upgrade as business grows
