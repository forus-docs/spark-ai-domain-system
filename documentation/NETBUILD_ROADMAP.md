# NetBuild Roadmap: From Task Management to Intelligent Business Automation

## Executive Vision

NetBuild is revolutionizing how Small, Medium, and Micro Enterprises (SMMEs) operate by transforming chaotic, manual processes into intelligent, self-improving workflows. We're not just digitizing tasks‚Äîwe're building an AI-powered ecosystem that learns, adapts, and generates solutions, while embedding financial services directly into business operations.

## The Journey So Far

### Phase 0: Foundation (Completed) ‚úì
**What We Built:**
- Three-tier task architecture (MasterTask ‚Üí DomainTask ‚Üí TaskExecution)
- Multi-tenant domain system with JWT authentication
- Chat-based task execution interface
- MongoDB-based persistence with QMS compliance
- Real-time SSE streaming for AI assistance

**Why It Matters:**
We created the scaffolding for a revolution. While others offer static task lists, we built a living system where tasks flow naturally through organizations, maintaining perfect audit trails and enabling AI assistance at every step.

### Strategic Pivot Decision (January 2025)
After careful analysis, we've decided to rebuild NetBuild as a modern UI layer on top of Camunda 7 rather than maintaining our own workflow engine. This strategic pivot:
- **Accelerates enterprise features** by 6-12 months
- **Reduces technical debt** significantly
- **Enables focus** on our unique value: chat interface and SMME accessibility
- **Maintains cost-effectiveness** through shared infrastructure
- **Future-proofs** the platform with proven, scalable technology

## The Roadmap Ahead

### Phase 1: Domain Empowerment (Q1 2025) üöÄ

- Domain-specific task libraries
- Role-based access control
- Custom branding and configuration

**The Value Proposition:**
*"Transform your business ecosystem in minutes, not months. Join NetBuild and instantly access industry-specific best practices, proven workflows, and AI assistance tailored to your domain. Whether you're a logistics company in Lagos or a textile manufacturer in Mumbai, your domain becomes a smart, self-organizing ecosystem."*

**Key Features:**
- One-click domain creation

- Predictive task completion

**The Value Proposition:**
*"Your workstreams become intelligent collaborators, not just communication channels. Imagine AI that watches your conversations, understands your goals, and automatically creates, assigns, and even completes tasks. It's like having a brilliant operations manager who never sleeps, learns from every interaction, and gets smarter with each completed workflow."*

**Proof of Concept Deliverables:**
- Chat-based task creation from natural language
- AI task assignment based on skills and availability
- Automatic SOP generation from successful patterns
- Performance prediction and bottleneck identification

### Phase 3: Rebuilding on Camunda - Enterprise-Grade Foundation (Q2-Q3 2025) üè≠

**What We're Building:**
- **NetBuild as a modern UI layer on top of Camunda 7**

- Optional isolated engines for enterprise clients
- Complete migration from custom auth to Camunda's proven system

**The Value Proposition:**
*"Transform NetBuild from a standalone app to a powerful UI layer on Camunda's battle-tested foundation. By rebuilding on Camunda, we eliminate months of custom development, gain enterprise features instantly, and can focus on what makes NetBuild special‚Äîthe chat interface, domain focus, and SMME accessibility. Best of all, small businesses share infrastructure costs while large enterprises get dedicated resources when needed."*

**Architecture Revolution:**
```
NetBuild UI (Chat, Domains) ‚Üí API Gateway ‚Üí Camunda Services
                                    ‚Üì
