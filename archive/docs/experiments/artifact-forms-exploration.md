# Artifact Forms Exploration

## Overview

This document explores using artifacts for form-based data collection in the Spark AI Domain System, inspired by LibreChat's artifact capabilities.

## Why Artifacts for Forms?

1. **Interactive UI Generation** - AI can generate complete form interfaces based on process requirements
2. **Live Preview** - Forms render in real-time within the chat interface
3. **Iterative Refinement** - Users can request changes and see updates immediately
4. **Code Export** - Generated forms can be exported as React components or HTML
5. **Future Integration** - Forms can be connected to smart contracts and process automation

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Basic Form Artifacts (Current)
- Display extracted data in an artifact-style component
- Allow inline editing of fields
- Provide submit/cancel actions
- Show form in a distinct visual container

### Phase 2: AI-Generated Forms
- AI generates complete form components based on requirements
- Support for various input types (text, date, select, etc.)
- Validation rules included in the artifact
- Real-time preview in chat interface

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- Form state management
- Multi-step forms
- Conditional logic
- Integration with process execution

## Example Use Case: Identity Verification

When a user uploads an ID document:

1. **Current Approach**: AI extracts data and shows JSON
2. **Artifact Approach**: AI generates an interactive form artifact

```javascript
// AI-generated form artifact
const IdentityForm = () => {
  const [formData, setFormData] = useState({
    firstName: 'John',
    lastName: 'Doe',
    idNumber: '123456789',
    dateOfBirth: '1990-01-01',
    nationality: 'US'
  });

  return (
    <form className="space-y-4">
      <Input 
        label="First Name" 
        value={formData.firstName}
        onChange={(e) => setFormData({...formData, firstName: e.target.value})}
        required
      />
      {/* ... more fields ... */}
    </form>
  );
};
```

## Benefits Over Modal Popup

1. **Stays in Context** - Form remains part of the conversation flow
2. **Version History** - Each iteration is preserved in chat history
3. **AI Assistance** - Can ask AI to modify form structure or validation
4. **Export Capability** - Forms can be saved and reused
5. **Progressive Enhancement** - Start simple, add complexity as needed

## Technical Implementation

### ArtifactDisplay Component
- Renders different artifact types (form, react, html, etc.)
- Provides interactive form rendering for form artifacts
- Includes copy and fullscreen actions
- Emits interaction events for parent handling

### Integration with Chat
- AI generates artifact JSON with form structure
- Chat interface renders ArtifactDisplay component
- User interactions update form state
- Submit action sends data back to process

## Future Enhancements

1. **Form Builder UI** - Visual form builder integrated with AI
2. **Template Library** - Reusable form templates for common processes
3. **Smart Contract Integration** - Forms that directly interact with blockchain
4. **Multi-language Support** - Forms generated in user's preferred language
5. **Accessibility Features** - WCAG compliant form generation

## Conclusion

Using artifacts for forms aligns with Spark's vision of AI-assisted process automation. It provides a foundation for future features while maintaining a clean, conversational interface.
