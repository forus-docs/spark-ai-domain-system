# LibreChat-Style Artifact Implementation

## Problem
- Inline artifact forms were causing scroll issues and console errors
- Large forms disrupted chat flow
- Nested scrolling contexts created viewport bouncing
- File preview components had memory leaks

## Solution: LibreChat Pattern
Implemented the same pattern LibreChat uses for artifacts:

### 1. Artifact Button
Instead of rendering forms inline, show a compact button in the chat that users click to view the artifact.

### 2. Slide-out Panel
Artifacts open in a slide-out panel from the right side:
- Full height for better viewing
- Separate scroll context
- Clean backdrop overlay
- Responsive width (full on mobile, 50% on desktop)

### 3. No Inline Rendering
- Forms don't disrupt chat flow
- No nested scroll containers
- Better performance (artifacts only render when opened)
- Cleaner chat interface

## Implementation Details

### New Components
1. **ArtifactButton** (`/app/components/artifact-button.tsx`)
   - Compact button showing artifact title and type
   - Click to open panel

2. **ArtifactPanel** (`/app/components/artifact-panel.tsx`)
   - Slide-out panel container
   - Handles backdrop and animations
   - Passes interactions to ArtifactDisplay

### Updated Components
1. **SmartMessageDisplay** (`/app/components/smart-message-display.tsx`)
   - Now renders ArtifactButton instead of inline ArtifactDisplay
   - Manages panel open/close state
   - Handles artifact interactions

### Benefits
1. **No Scroll Issues** - Panel has its own scroll context
2. **Better Performance** - Artifacts only render when needed
3. **Cleaner UI** - Chat stays readable without large forms
4. **Mobile Friendly** - Full-screen panel on mobile devices
5. **No Console Errors** - Removed problematic file preview patterns

## Usage
When AI generates an artifact (form, error, etc.):
1. A button appears in the chat
2. User clicks the button
3. Panel slides in from the right
4. User interacts with the artifact
5. Panel closes on completion or cancel

## Testing
1. Upload an ID card image
2. Wait for form artifact button to appear
3. Click button to open panel
4. Verify smooth scrolling in panel
5. Verify chat scrolling still works
6. Check console for errors
