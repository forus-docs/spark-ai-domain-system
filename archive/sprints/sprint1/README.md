# Sprint 1: MVP Implementation

## Sprint Goal
Deliver a working MVP of the Spark AI Domain System with core navigation, domain browsing, and role selection functionality using mock data.

## Sprint Deliverables

### ✅ Core Features
1. **Domain Browser** - Browse all available domains in grid layout
2. **Domain Join Flow** - Complete join process with role selection
3. **Multi-Role Support** - Handle domains with multiple roles
4. **Domain Switching** - Switch between joined domains via dropdown
5. **Navigation System** - Domain-aware sidebar navigation
6. **Stubbed Sections** - All content sections show appropriate empty states

## Key Implementation Details

### Data Model
- `Domain` - Core domain structure with roles
- `DomainRole` - Role definition with benefits
- `UserDomainMembership` - User's membership tracking

### State Management
- Context API for global state
- Session persistence for memberships
- Domain context switching

### UI/UX
- Minimalist design approach
- Subtle animations and interactions
- Responsive layout (mobile/desktop)

## Acceptance Criteria

### User Stories Completed
- [ ] As a user, I can browse all available domains
- [ ] As a user, I can join a domain with a specific role
- [ ] As a user, I can switch between my joined domains
- [ ] As a user, I can see domain-specific navigation items
- [ ] As a user, I can see appropriate empty states for unbuilt features

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] TypeScript with no errors
- [ ] All components properly typed
- [ ] Mock data loads correctly
- [ ] State persists in session
- [ ] Responsive on all devices

## Not Included (Future Sprints)
- Real API integration
- Authentication system
- Payment processing
- Smart contract integration
- Actual content for sections
- Domain application process

## Development Notes

### Quick Start
```bash
# Use the mock data
import { mockDomains, mockUser } from './mock-data/mock-data'

# Reference the implementation spec
See specs/phase1-implementation-spec.md for detailed requirements

# Follow the component examples
See component-examples.tsx for implementation patterns
```
