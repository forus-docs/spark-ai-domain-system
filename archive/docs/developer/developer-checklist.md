## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Don't forget domain context** - Many components need to know current domain
2. **Handle empty states** - User might not have joined any domains
3. **Preserve gradients** - Each domain has specific gradient classes
4. **Role IDs matter** - Don't use role names as IDs
5. **Click outside** - Dropdown should close when clicking elsewhere
6. **Session persistence** - State should survive page refresh
7. **Domain-specific navigation** - Hide items when no domain selected

## Questions for Product Owner

1. Should domain join be reversible (leave domain)?
2. What happens when user tries to join with existing membership?
3. Should role changes be allowed after joining?
4. How should errors be displayed?
5. Any specific loading state requirements?

## Notes for Phase 2

- API integration will replace mock data
- Authentication will be added
- Real payment processing needed
- Smart contract integration required
- Content sections will be built out
