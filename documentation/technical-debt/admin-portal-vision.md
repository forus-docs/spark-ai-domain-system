# Admin Portal Vision

## Overview
The Admin Portal will be a dedicated interface for domain administrators to manage their domain's configuration, including task auto-adoption settings.

## Auto-Adoption Feature

### Purpose
Allow domain administrators to configure automatic adoption of master tasks into their domain based on predefined rules and criteria.

### Key Components

1. **Auto-Adoption Rules Engine**
   - Category-based rules (e.g., auto-adopt all "Finance" tasks)
   - Role-based rules (e.g., auto-adopt tasks for specific roles)
   - Keyword matching in task titles/descriptions
   - Scheduled adoption checks (daily/weekly)

2. **Configuration Interface**
   - Toggle auto-adoption on/off per domain
   - Create and manage adoption rules
   - Preview tasks that would be adopted
   - Review adoption history and logs

3. **Notification System**
   - Alert admins when new master tasks match rules
   - Summary of auto-adopted tasks
   - Option to review and undo adoptions

### Technical Implementation

1. **Database Schema**
   ```javascript
   // New collection: domainAutoAdoptionRules
   {
     domainId: ObjectId,
     isActive: Boolean,
     rules: [{
       type: 'category' | 'role' | 'keyword' | 'all',
       value: String | Array,
       excludePatterns: Array<String>
     }],
     lastRun: Date,
     schedule: 'manual' | 'daily' | 'weekly'
   }
   ```

2. **Background Job**
   - Cron job to check for new master tasks
   - Match against active domain rules
   - Create domainTasks automatically
   - Log adoption actions

3. **Admin Portal Routes**
   - `/admin/[domain]/auto-adoption` - Main configuration
   - `/admin/[domain]/auto-adoption/history` - Adoption logs
   - `/admin/[domain]/auto-adoption/preview` - Test rules

### Benefits
- Reduces manual work for domain admins
- Ensures domains stay updated with relevant tasks
- Maintains governance through configurable rules
- Provides audit trail of adoptions

### Future Enhancements
- ML-based task recommendations
- Cross-domain task sharing
- Custom approval workflows
- Integration with task request system
