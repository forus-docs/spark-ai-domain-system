## Why These Files Were Archived

1. **Sprint Documentation**: Sprint 1 is complete, Sprint 2 planning is outdated
2. **Specifications**: Implementation has evolved beyond original specs
3. **Experiments**: UI experiments that were tested but not implemented
4. **Historical Docs**: Completed integrations and old references
5. **Bloated Documentation**: Replaced with lean, actionable docs
